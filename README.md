# [Currently-Unamed]

A dashboard for UCI students including a task list and a notebook, with a display of the current weather and a motivational quote to start the user's day. We plan on implementing a simple login-based user interface (possibly using a database). The context of the application will be a preview of the user's day.

Partners: Yousef Khan and David Kang

We will be using React.js + Vite + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI, and are considering using Supabase.
